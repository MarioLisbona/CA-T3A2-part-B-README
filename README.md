Those changes are eventually reflected in the browser's DOM structure. The package provides developed with methods to maniupalte the virual dom, inlcuding `.render()` and `.findDOMNode`

`react-router-dom: ^6.7.0` - React Router is used to create an SPA (Single Page Application). It provides a library that lets developers take advantage of client-side rendering routing.
